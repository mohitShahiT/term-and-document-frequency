Social media are interactive technologies that allow the creation or 
sharing/exchange of information, ideas, career interests, and other 
forms of expression via virtual communities and networks.[1][2] While 
challenges to the definition of social media arise[3][4] due to the broad 
variety of stand-alone and built-in social-media services currently available, 
there are some common features:[2]

Social media are interactive Web 2.0 Internet-based applications.[2][5][6]
User-generated content—such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos, and data generated through all online interactions—is the lifeblood of social media.[2][5]
Users create service-specific profiles for the website or app that are designed and maintained by the social-media organization.[2][7]
Social media helps the development of online social networks by connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals or groups.
