Instagram (commonly abbreviated to IG, Insta or the gram)
is an American photo and video sharing social networking
service created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.
In April 2012, Facebook acquired the service for approximately
US$1 billion in cash and stock. The app allows users to upload media
that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical
tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers.
Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view 
trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to
add their content to a personal feed.
